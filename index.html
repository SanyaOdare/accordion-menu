      <div class="label">Interviewing With Us</div>
      <div class="content">There are certain things you can do to properly prepare for an interview. Let’s walk through them</div>

    <div class="container">
      <div class="label">Come ready with questions</div>
      <div class="content">Next, come to the interview with your own questions. This not only shows you care about understanding Google and the position you’re applying for, but it’s also a testament to the research you’ve done by looking into our company. Besides, this is your opportunity to interview us as well. You hear that a lot, right? But honestly, it’s important to us.</div>

    <div class="container">
      <div class="label">Find connections</div>
      <div class="content">First off, re-read your resume and the job description to help you draw lines between the two. Where do they connect? We want you to take every opportunity to set yourself up for success.</div>
    </div>
    <hr>
    <div class="container">
      <div class="label">Look back at past</div>
      <div class="content">You should also go back through your own work history. That may not sound like something you need to prepare for, but most of us have done more than we think and it’s easy to forget some of our own wins (and lessons from mistakes). We want you to be calm and confident.</div>
    </div>
    <hr>
    <div class="container">
      <div class="label">Talk through your answers</div>
      <div class="content">When we’re talking with you about your work and the position in question, express your ideas, ask questions, and don’t be afraid to work the problem with us. Why? Because the questions often leave room for clarification.</div>
    </div>

      <div class="label">Prepare for the day</div>
      <div class="content">If you’re doing a virtual interview, take some time to prepare your space. Find a quiet area with good internet connection where you won’t be disturbed. Check your mic, your video, and your Wi-Fi, to make sure that everything is in working order.</div>
